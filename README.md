# Interfacing-With-Tiva-C
## A Library made by me to interface with TM4C123GXL development board

## **NOTES:**

1. You can build and debug any example here using Code Composer Studio with TI compiler version 20.2.1.LTS.
2. Don't forget to look at the startup code when the example uses interrupts to make sure that the ISR procedure is added there.
3. All the examples are coded by me using the Tiva C datasheet, If you have troubles understanding anything or found any bugs you can contact me.
4. I don't use Tivaware drivers, all of these drivers are coded by me.
